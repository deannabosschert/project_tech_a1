### Data
So far I'll be using two relational tables with data:

**Account**

| ID | email | name | description | hash | sex | image |
|----|-------|------|-------------|------|-----|-------|
|    |       |      |             |      |     |       |
|    |       |      |             |      |     |       |
|    |       |      |             |      |     |       |

**Moodboards**
